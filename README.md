# Avex: another way to delete your data
Avex is a simple tool aiming to remove data from your hard drive making it unrecoverable. This project is to practice C++ as I'm still learning. **If you're looking for a reliable tool, I highly recommend checking out alternatives such as [Eraser](https://eraser.heidi.ie/), [SDelete](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sdelete) and many others.**

## The problem with normal deletion
Deleting something in OS such as Windows doesn't actually mean it's gone, even if you empty the Recycle Bin. The data is still on the disk, unless it got overwritten but even then, professional recovery tools out there can restore it to some degree.
